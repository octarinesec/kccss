title: Workload mounts a Service Account Token with the right to create/delete Pods
description: >-
  The Service Account Token allows the workload to query the Kubernetes API
  server for a specific list of resources and actions. A Service Account Token
  with the right to create and delete Pods would give that workload the ability
  to schedule new pods and stop current pods from running.

availability:
  impact: High
  description: >-
    The creation of many new pods can exhaust the CPU and memory available to
    the cluster, which would effectively make it unavailable. The rescheduling
    of running pods can also affect an application's availability, causing
    disruptions and downtime.

  Ensure that your RBAC Role/ClusterRole does not give broad access to pods:
  rules.resources [specific resources, do not include pods]
