title: Workload allows unsafe allocation of CPU resources
description: >-
  A container with full access (unmasked) to the host’s /proc command is able to
  retrieve information about all the activities and users on that host.
  /proc/sys allows a privileged user to change the runtime kernel parameters and
  impact how resources are shared amongst containers.
shortDescription: ''
availability:
  impact: High
  description: >-
    Sysctl is an interface that enables the container’s parameters to be
    changed, which could allow the container to grab more CPU resources than
    it’s allowed by its quota. This may starve other containers from CPU cycles,
    compromising the operations of the container, host and even the entire
    cluster.

  impact: Low
  description: >-
    Some of the sysctl interfaces allow the container to affect the performance
    of other containers and/or the host.
